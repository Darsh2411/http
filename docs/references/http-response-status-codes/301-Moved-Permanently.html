https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/301

<p>The HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) 301 Moved Permanently redirect status response code indicates that the resource requested has been definitively moved to the URL given by the Location headers. A browser redirects to this page and search engines update their links to the resource (in 'SEO-speak', it is said that the 'link-juice' is sent to the new URL).</p>


<p>Even if the specification requires the method (and the body) not to be altered when the redirection is performed, not all user-agents align with it - you can still find this type of bugged software out there.</p>
<p> It is therefore recommended to use the 301 code only as a response for GET or HEAD methods and to use the 308 Permanent Redirect for POST methods instead, as the method change is explicitly prohibited with this status.</p>
