    <h1>Keep-Alive</h1>
    <p>The Keep-Alive general header allows the sender to hint about how the connection may be used to set a timeout and
        a maximum amount of requests.</p>
    <p class="warning">The Connection header needs to be set to "keep-alive" for this header to have any meaning.</p>
    <p class="warning">Connection-specific header fields such as Connection and Keep-Alive are prohibited in HTTP/2.
        Chrome and Firefox ignore them in HTTP/2 responses, but Safari conforms to the HTTP/2 spec requirements and
        wonâ€™t load any response which contains them.</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>parameters</dt>
        <dd>
            A comma-separated list of parameters, each consisting of an identifier and a value separated by the equal
            sign ('='). The following identifiers are possible:
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>timeout: indicating the minimum amount of time an idle connection has to be kept opened (in
                    seconds). Note that timeouts longer than the TCP timeout may be ignored if no keep-alive TCP message
                    is set at the transport level.</li>
                <li>max: indicating the maximum number of requests that can be sent on this connection before closing
                    it. Unless 0, this value is ignored for non-pipelined connections as another request will be sent in
                    the next response. An HTTP pipeline can use it to limit the pipelining.</li>
            </ul>
        </dd>
