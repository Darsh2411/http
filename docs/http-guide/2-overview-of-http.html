        <h3>proxies</h3>
        <p> Proxies may perform numerous functions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>caching (the cache can be public or private, like the browser cache)</li>
            <li>filtering (like an antivirus scan or parental controls)</li>
            <li>load balancing (to allow multiple servers to serve the different requests)</li>
            <li>authentication (to control access to different resources)</li>
            <li>logging (allowing the storage of historical information)</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>basic aspects of http</h2>
    <section>
        <h3>http is simple</h3>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>http is extensible</h3>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>http is stateless, but not sessionless</h3>
        <p>HTTP is stateless: there is no link between two requests being successively carried out on the same
            connection. </p>
        <p>This immediately has the prospect of being problematic for users attempting to interact with certain pages
            coherently adv.
            连贯地；前后一致地；条理清楚地；互相偶合地；凝聚性地, for example, using e-commerce shopping baskets. </p>
        <p class="question">what does this mean? interact with certain pages coherently, is there a best practice?
            does it mean that you don't want every change will make a http request?
        </p>
        <p> But while the core of HTTP itself is stateless, HTTP cookies allow the use of stateful sessions. </p>
        <p>Using header extensibility, HTTP Cookies are added to the workflow, allowing session creation on each HTTP
            request to share the same context, or the same state.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>http and connections</h3>
        <p>A connection is controlled at the transport layer, and therefore fundamentally out of scope for HTTP.</p>
    </section>

    <h2>what can be controlled by http</h2>
    <dl>
        <dt>caching</dt>
        <dd>How documents are cached can be controlled by HTTP. The server can instruct proxies and clients, about what
            to cache and for how long. The client can instruct intermediate cache proxies to ignore the stored document.
        </dd>
        <dt>relaxing the origin constraint</dt>
        <dd>same origin
            <p class="question">why it says "same origin" constraint is a burden to the server</p>
        </dd>
        <dt>authentication</dt>
        <dd>WWW-Authenticate and similar headers, or by setting a specific session using HTTP cookies</dd>
        <dt>Proxy and tunneling</dt>
        <dd>Servers or clients are often located on intranets and hide their true IP address from other computers. HTTP
            requests then go through proxies to cross this network barrier. Not all proxies are HTTP proxies. The SOCKS
            protocol, for example, operates at a lower level. Other protocols, like ftp, can be handled by these
            proxies.</dd>
        <dt>sessions</dt>
        <dd>Using HTTP cookies allows you to link requests with the state of the server. This creates sessions, despite
            basic HTTP being a state-less protocol. This is useful not only for e-commerce shopping baskets, but also
            for any site allowing user configuration of the output.
            <p class="note">this mentions shopping basket, why? is that basket information saved in cookie then sent to
                server?</p>
        </dd>
    </dl>
