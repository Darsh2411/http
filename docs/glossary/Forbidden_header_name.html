    <h1>Forbidden header nameForbidden header name</h1>
    <p>A forbidden header name is the name of any HTTP header that cannot be modified programmatically; specifically, an HTTP request header name (in contrast with a Forbidden response header name).</p>
    <p>Modifying such headers is forbidden because the user agent retains full control over them. Names starting with `Sec-` are reserved for creating new headers safe from APIs using Fetch that grant developers control over headers, such as XMLHttpRequest.</p>
    <p>Forbidden header names start with Proxy- or Sec-, or are one of the following names:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>..</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="warning">The User-Agent header is no longer forbidden, as per spec — see forbidden header name list (this was implemented in Firefox 43) — it can now be set in a Fetch Headers object, or via XHR setRequestHeader().  However, Chrome will silently drop the header from Fetch requests (see Chromium bug 571722).</p>
