                    <p>A <strong>media type</strong> (also known as a <strong>Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions or
                            MIME type</strong> ) is a standard that indicates the nature and format of a document, file,
                        or assortment of bytes. </p>
                    <p class="important">
                        Browsers use the MIME type, not the file extension, to determine how to process a URL, so it's
                        important that web servers send the correct MIME type in the response's Content-Type header. If
                        this is not correctly configured, browsers are likely to misinterpret the contents of files and
                        sites will not work correctly, and downloaded files may be mishandled.

                        <code>type/subtype</code>
                        <p>The type represents the general category into which the data type falls, such as video or
                            text. </p>
                        <p>The subtype identifies the exact kind of data of the specified type the MIME type represents.

                        <ul>

                        <code>type/subtype;parameter=value</code>
                        <p> for any MIME type whose main type is text, the optional charset parameter can be used to
                            specify the character set used for the characters in the data. If no charset is specified,
                            the default is ASCII (US-ASCII) unless overridden by the user agent's settings. </p>
                        <p>An optional parameter can be added to provide additional details:</p>
                        <ul>

                        <p>MIME types are case-insensitive but are traditionally written in lowercase, with the

                            <h3>types</h3>
                            <p>There are two classes of type: <strong>discrete</strong> adj. 离散的，不连续的 and
                                <strong>multipart</strong>.</p>
                            <p>Discrete types are types which represent a single file or medium, such as a single text
                                or music file, or a single video. </p>
                            <p>A multipart type is one which represents a document that's comprised of multiple
                                component parts, each of which may have its own individual MIME type;</p>
                            <p>or, a multipart type may encapsulate multiple files being sent together in one
                                transaction. For example, multipart MIME types are used when attaching multiple files to
                                an email.</p>

                                <p>Multipart types indicate a category of document broken into pieces, often with
                                    different MIME types; </p>
                                <p>they can also be used — especially in email scenarios — to represent multiple,
                                    separate files which are all part of the same transaction.</p>
                                <p>They represent a composite document.</p>
                                <hr>
                                <p>With the exception of <br>
                                    multipart/form-data, used in the POST method of HTML Forms,and <br> 
                                    multipart/byteranges, used with 206 Partial Content to send part of a document,
                                </p>
                                <p> HTTP doesn't handle multipart documents in a special way: the message is transmitted to the browser (which will likely show a "Save As" window if it doesn't know how to display the document).</p>

                                    <dt>message</dt>
                                    <dd>A message that encapsulates other messages. This can be used, for instance, to represent an email that includes a forwarded message as part of its data, or to allow sending very large messages in chunks as if it were multiple messages. Examples include message/rfc822 (for forwarded or replied-to message quoting) and message/partial to allow breaking a large message into smaller ones automatically to be reassembled by the recipient.</dd>
                                    <dt>multipart</dt>
                                    <dd>Data that is comprised of multiple components which may individually have different MIME types. Examples include multipart/form-data (for data produced using the FormData API) and multipart/byteranges (defined in RFC 7233: 5.4.1 and used with HTTP's 206 "Partial Content" response returned when the fetched data is only part of the content, such as is delivered using the Range header).</dd>

                            <p>This is the default for binary files. As it means unknown binary file, browsers usually don't execute it, or even ask if it should be executed. They treat it as if the Content-Disposition header was set to attachment, and propose a "Save As" dialog.</p>

                            <p>This is the default for textual files. Even if it really means "unknown textual file," browsers assume they can display it.</p>
                            <p class="warning">Note that text/plain does not mean "any kind of textual data." If they expect a specific kind of textual data, they will likely not consider it a match. Specifically if they download a text/plain file from a <link> element declaring a CSS file, they will not recognize it as a valid CSS file if presented with text/plain. The CSS mime type text/css must be used.</p>

                            <p>CSS files used to style a Web page must be sent with text/css. If a server doesn't recognize the .css suffix for CSS files, it may send them with text/plain or application/octet-stream MIME types. If so, they won't be recognized as CSS by most browsers and will be ignored.</p>
